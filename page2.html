                    <h3>Skiing</h3>
                    <p>I'm an avid skier. ( You might have picked that up from my screen name! ) My parents taught me how to ski when I was very young,
                    and now it has become my favorite pastime in the winter months. My favorite part is if you can get up to the mountain right after a 
                    big snowstorm, and be the first person on the ski lift. Then you get to ski down through fresh, untouched powder snow.
                     This particular picture is on one of my favorite ski runs at Hoodoo Ski Area.</p>

                    <h3>ATVing/Quading</h3>
                    <p>During the summer when the snow melts, its time to break out the Quads! I've been riding since I was very young. 
                        I have a lot of fun riding full speed down the beach, or through the twists and turns of a trail in the woods.
                        I usually take at least a weekend per month in the summer to do some riding out at the Oregon coast dunes. </p>

                    <h3>Custom Computer Builds</h3>
                    <p>The thing that got me into computers in the first place was building them. I built my first PC when I was 13, and since then I've built
                    many custom PC's for myself or for clients. My personal favorite was the 50tb storage server I built for a friend's business. I enjoy researching
                    and creating systems for specific uses. (Like my friend's business) There are always new technologies, and new opportunities to build something
                    better.</p>
